# What is this

Blender Add-on to mint your render on [Mintbase](https://mintbase.xyz) and upload sources on the [Varda Vault](https://vault.varda.vision) for your collectors
Please check to my introduction video to see how it works.

# Earendill
This module leverages the [near protocol API](https://github.com/near/near-api-py) on the [Blender UI](https://blender.org).

Earendil is a collab between the Mintbase and the Varda DEV team to allow minting and locking secret content to your mintbase NFT.
For a visual introduction, please watch the [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/coming-soon).

You can either grab the file from here on GitHub, or alternatively on [Gumroad](https://jeeltcraft.gumroad.com/).

Documentation (work-in-progress) is available on the [Website Wiki](https://earendill.varda.vision/).

For more information on the thought process behind Earendill, please open an issue on this repo.
