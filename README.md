# Add-on wrapper for Near python API

This repo just adds an `__init__.py` to allow Earendill users to install it via an add-on.

# Earendill
A module to use the near protocol API on the Blender UI.

Earendil is a collab between the Mintbase and the Varda DEV teams to allow minting and locking secret content to your mintbase NFT.
For a visual introduction, please watch the [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/coming-soon).

You can either grab the file from here on GitHub, or alternatively on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/easybpy).

Documentation (work-in-progress) is available on the [Website Wiki](https://earendill.varda.vision/).

For more information on the thought process behind Earendill, please open an issue on this repo.
